# Python + Firestore for Real World Projects

Firestore is a [NoSQL]() database and as such operates under a different set of rules from [Relational]() and [Graph]() databases.

Covering database types is outside the scope of this tutorial -- however, even amongst NoSQL databases e.g. `MongoDB`, `ArangoDB`, `CouchDB` etc.
Firestore is a little bit different in it's core concepts.

For example looking at the image below it is clear that Firestore has a different architectural model from MongoDB (One of the Popular NoSQL Database Engines).
